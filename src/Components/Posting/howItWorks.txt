Post is currently just a conglomerated source of most of the api fetchs. The location of the fetches will likely be changed, but I just wanted to set 
them up so that we had a baseline that we could slightly alter to meet our needs. Any fetch that alters the users postResults will trigger another fetch to redisplay the updated
results.

THINGS TO FIX/IMPROVE:
1)Currently, only the user's own posts are being displayed
2)res.json() in the delete fetch returns an error. I implemented JSON.stringify(res) as a workaround, but it should probably be looked into more
3)I don't currently know what to do with the display one post by id fetch, so I'm not going to fetch it for now
4)Update is working, but not exactly functional. Currently it updates the post that is clicked and automatically inputs the current state values for title, feeling and body.
I decided not to go too in depth with this one because it's a lot more liable to change than the other fetches.
5)Sessiontoken currently isnt strictly typed(it accepts anything)
